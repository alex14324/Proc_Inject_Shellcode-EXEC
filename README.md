Introduction

Process injection is a technique used to execute arbitrary code in the context of another process. Shellcode, a small piece of code used as the payload in exploits, can be injected into a target process to perform various actions. This project provides an educational framework for understanding how these techniques work.
Installation
Prerequisites

    Windows operating system
    Visual Studio (or any compatible C/C++ compiler)
    Basic understanding of C/C++ programming

Steps

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/alex14324/Proc_Inject_Shellcode-EXEC.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    cd Proc_Inject_Shellcode-EXEC

    Build the project using Visual Studio or your preferred compiler.

Usage
Example

To execute shellcode in a target process, compile the InjectShellcode.cpp file and run it with the target process ID:

InjectShellcode.exe <TargetProcessID>


Replace <TargetProcessID> with the ID of the target process you wish to inject into.
Notes

    Ensure you have the necessary permissions to inject into the target process.
    Testing should be conducted in a controlled environment to avoid unintended consequences.

Technical Details

This implementation utilizes various Windows API functions to facilitate process injection, including:

    OpenProcess
    VirtualAllocEx
    WriteProcessMemory
    CreateRemoteThread

The project provides a straightforward example of how to write shellcode directly into the memory of a target process and execute it.
Ethical Considerations

While understanding process injection and shellcode execution is important for cybersecurity and malware analysis, it is crucial to emphasize ethical use. This knowledge should not be applied maliciously or without consent.
Reminder:

    Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system.
    Use this knowledge for ethical hacking, security research, or educational purposes only.
